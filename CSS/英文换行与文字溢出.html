      Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan: one is a woman from a traditional family whose
      marriage has failed, while the other is a modern gentleman reveling in the
      smoky alleys of the city. Their paths first cross through the matchmaking
      of Liusu's younger sister, Bai Baoluo. Fan Liuyuan invites the Bai family
      to a dance hall, where they sit in stunned silence, and only Liusu dances
      with him for a couple of rounds. Originally there to meet Bai Baoluo, Fan
      Liuyuan finds himself attracted to Liusu. A few days later, the
      introducer, Mrs. Xu, visits the Bai residence and informs them that Fan
      Liuyuan has left Shanghai. She suggests that Bai Liusu accompany her to
      Hong Kong, to which Liusu agrees. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, Liusu
      encounters Fan Liuyuan, already anticipating this meeting. In the
      subsequent days, Liuyuan takes Liusu on various outings, yet he does not
      even touch her hand. He goes to great lengths to bring Liusu to Hong Kong,
      hoping to shield her from the gossip of the world and wishing to return
      her to a state of pure love. Liusu desires a sense of belonging; she
      believes that if she can make it difficult for him to possess her, she
      might become Mrs. Fan. However, Fan Liuyuan remains inactive. It is not
      until they are on the beach, playfully splashing each other and laughing,
      that Liusu suddenly feels offended, stands up, and walks towards the
      hotel, with Liuyuan not following her.
